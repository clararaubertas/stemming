<h2>What is Stemming?</h2>
<p>Stemming is a place for women and girls who are interested or involved in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) to connect with each other to share information and opportunities.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Who can join Stemming?</h2>
<p>Stemming is for all women and girls interested in any level of science, technology, engineering and math.</p>
<p>If you're not a woman, or not interested in the STEM fields,
you're still welcome; however, trolling or abuse will not be tolerated, and we ask that you respect the site's primary purpose of encouraging female interest and participation in these fields. Anyone posting trollish, inappropriate, offensive, or wildly off-topic content or who does not appear to make a good-faith effort to respect the purpose of the site may have their posts and/or account deleted at the sole discretion of an administrator.</p>

<h2>Who can blog on Stemming?</h2>
<p><strong>Everyone!</strong> You can blog about anything you want on your personal stemming blog; these blog posts will be displayed on your profile, and anyone on the site will be able to read or comment on them.</p>
<p>A stemming administrator will choose selected blog posts from stemming users to feature on the front page of the site (generally, posts the administrator thinks are of the most general interest to the site's users).

<h2>How do I network using Stemming?</h2>
<p>Mostly, we hope you'll connect with others with similar interests, and possibly set up in-person meetings (that's what the "networking", "mentoring", and "menteeing" buttons on users' profiles are for.</p>
<ul>
<li>A programmer looking for a job might connect for networking with other users near her location, hoping to get in touch with someone who can share opportunities with her</li>
<li>A high school student who thinks she might want to major in biology might connect for mentoring with a professional biologist in her town; they can meet for lunch and discuss what's involved in a biology career</li>
</ul>
