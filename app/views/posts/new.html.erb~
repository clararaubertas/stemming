<h3>What should I blog about?</h3>
<p>You can blog about anything you find interesting! All your blog posts will show up on your profile and help other users get to know you; selected blog posts that the administrators think might appeal to the general community will get promoted to the front page.</p>
<p>Some ideas: tell the story of how you got involved in your field; share links and resources of interest to the stemming community (like posts on other websites about women in STEM, or educational opportunities you've learned about); post something of technical interest; tell a story about an experience at work or school; ask a question you'd like other stemmers to weigh in on; link to cool things you've posted or read elsewhere; post something fun and silly!</p>
